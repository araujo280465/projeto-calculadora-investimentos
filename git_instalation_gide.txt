🧾 Step 1: Create .gitignore
Save this in the root of your project as .gitignore:

add this to the file
        # .gitignore
        node_modules
        dist
        .env
        .vscode
        .DS_Store


💻 Step 2: Initialize Git & Commit
In your project folder terminal (VS Code or PowerShell):

cd move to the directory you want to install

run this in the terminal
        git init
        git add .
        git commit -m "Initial commit: THE NAME OF YOUR REPOSITORY"

        


🐱 Step 3: Create Repo on GitHub

Go to https://github.com/new

Repository name: THE NAME OF YOUR Repository (or anything you want)

replace <THE NAME OF YOUR REPOSITORY> with your repository name:

git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/<THE NAME OF YOUR REPOSITORY>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
